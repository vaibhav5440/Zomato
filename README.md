# Zomato Bangalore Restaurants

# **Over View**
In Bangalore, this project is called Zomato, and the analysis and in-depth research on this subject are important. To suit their different demands, Zomato puts customers, catering partners, and delivery partners together. Customers use this phase to research and discover new restaurants, submit comments and reviews, rate the quality of the food and delivery timings, reserve a table, make payments online, and upload photographs. Zomato provides its partners with the necessary capabilities, enabling them to attract customers and grow their market. Zomato is also adept at organizing trustworthy and efficient dispatch services. Zomato runs a single desk sourcing operation that offers partner restaurants only the best food and products. For our food service partners, Zomato also offers chances for open and adaptable pay.
# **Problem Statement**
The main factor behind Bangalore's consistently high demand for restaurants is the large number of visitors that travel here each day from all over the world to the Indian IT hub. There are almost 12000 restaurants, and each one offers a variety of food. The constant high demand for food is the cause of the frequent opening of new eateries in this area. However, because the majority of restaurants here serve the same food, it is quite challenging for them to compete and maintain themselves against well-established restaurants. Many individuals rely primarily on restaurant cuisine in this area of India because it is a hub for IT. The fundamental concept is to analyze the business problem to gain a clear understanding of the variables influencing the opening of various types of restaurants in various locations throughout Bangalore, the overall rating of each restaurant, and many other things.
